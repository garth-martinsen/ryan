# file: gui_client.py    purpose: liason between gui and adc_client thru db_server. runs in python3 env.
# copied and modified:  https://github.com/juliogema/python-basic-socket/blob/main/client.py
# Notes: For each server response, only one client request can be made eg: on purpose:11 can send request(20)
# TODO 2: Find out why the request to measure(0) from gui_client causes problems.

"""All msgs must have fields: purpose, sender_id, msg_id.  The adc_client  Configuration includes [10,20,30,40,50]  50 tells server
that adc_client is READY for requests.
... Use the same and add request(60) for config records for gui_client. All msgs with purpose>99 require forwarding to the other
client. Following the response for 60, send following requests to test forwarding: 
100: measure(chan)
200: calibrate(chan, vin)
300: repeating measurement sequence includes [3 measure(chan), 1 wait].  Future...
400: repeating calibration sequence includes 3 sets of stepping vins with a delay to set Power supply. Future..."""
